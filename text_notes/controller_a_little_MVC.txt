### Notes on controllers. 

- Is each method in a controller an action?

In a controller I might type something like this:

___________________________________________________

def index
  @portfolio_items = Portfolio.all
end
___________________________________________________

 - When I type 'Portfolio.all' I call to the Model and the @portfolio_items allows the controller to communicate with the view (what the users sees).

 - So the Model communicates with the Controller and the Controller communicates with the View.

 - The controller only communicates with the view if I have a template. Which is typically an html file named somthing like this -- name_of_file.html.erb. -- The 'erb' means 'embedded ruby', this allows me to write ruby code inside of my html document.
