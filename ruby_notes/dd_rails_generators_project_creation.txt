#### Basic steps for creating a project ####

1. Decide where I want to store my project then navigate to that location in the terminal

2. Enter in the rails command that generates a new app
  - rails new AppName -T --database=postgresql
      What does some of these things mean?
        - I use the '-T' command when I don't want to include tests.
        - I use the '--database=postgresql' command when I want to create a postgre database. Which is typicaly what I will do.

3. After rails generates the application I navigate to the application in the terminal. 

4. After I navigate to the application I create the database.
  - rails db:create

#### Basic steps for generating a scaffold ####

1. Determine which attributes/datatypes I will use in my scaffold.

2. Create the scaffold
  - rails g scaffold Featurename attribute:datetype attribute:datatype

3. After rails generates the scaffold, it's important that I check the migration file that rails created to ensure I spelled everything correctly when I entered the 'rails g scaffold' command because after I migrate the database the migration file can't be changed.
  - I find the migration file I want to check in the following location -- db/migrate/'file will be here'

4. Migrate the database
 - rails db:migrate

#### How to customize my generators ####

### How to override the sytlesheets that the scaffold generated through the 'lib' directory?

1. Create a new directory inside of the 'lib' directory and name it 'templates'.

2. Create two more directories inside of the 'template' directory named 'erb' then create one more directory inside of 'erb' called 'scaffold'.

3. Create a new file inside of the 'scaffold' directory named 'index.html.erb'
