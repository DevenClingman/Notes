# printing

puts "something" # puts doesn't return the string

p "something" #this returns the entire string # I can also write print instead of p

p [1,2,3] # I can also print arrays # looks like this [1,2,3]

puts [1,2,3] 
#   Outputs
# => 1
# => 2 
# => 3
 
# I typically use puts when i am prompting the user. However, otherwise I can use them interchangabley.
